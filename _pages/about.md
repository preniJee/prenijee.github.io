My name is Preni. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, expected to graduate May 2026. I work in the [Morality and Language Lab (MOLA)](https://www.mola-lab.org/) with my advisor Morteza Dehghani. My research spans **human-centered NLP**, **responsible AI**, **computational social science**, and **subjectivity in language**—including modeling and evaluating subjective interpretations of language and developing rubric-based preference data synthesis and personalized alignment approaches.
