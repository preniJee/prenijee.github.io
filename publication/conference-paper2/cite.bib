    abstract = "Twitter has become a major platform for users to express their opinions on any topic and engage in debates. User debates and interactions usually lead to massive content regarding a specific topic which is called a Trend. Twitter trend extraction aims at finding these relevant groups of content that are generated in a short period. The most straightforward approach for this problem is using Hashtags, however, tweets without hashtags are not considered this way. In order to overcome this issue and extract trends using all tweets, we propose a graph-based approach where graph nodes represent tweets as well as words and hashtags. More specifically, we propose a modified version of RankClus algorithm to extract trends from the constructed tweets graph. The proposed approach is also capable of ranking tweets, words and hashtags in each trend with respect to their importance and relevance to the topic. The proposed algorithm is used to extract trends from several twitter datasets, where it produced consistent and coherent results.",
